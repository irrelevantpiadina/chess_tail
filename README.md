# chess_tail
A simple chess GUI, initally made to test out the [libchess library](https://github.com/irrelevantpiadina/libchess)

---

you can either play against yourself, against an engine, or have two engines play against each other

it could be useful if you want to test your chess engine to see how it performs against others

---

to add a chess engines to the list of available engines, simply copy and paste the executable, as well as any files it may need, in the assets/engines folder

---

there is currently no interface for piece promotion, instead you'll have to use your keyboard

after moving a pawn to its promotion square, press:
| Key      | Promotion |
| :------- |  ------:  |
| N        | Knight    |
| B        | Bishop    |
| R        | Rook      |
| Q        | Queen     |
